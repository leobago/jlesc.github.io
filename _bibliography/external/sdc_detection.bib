% %% Convention for BibTeX keys
%
% Construct the BibTeX key according to the following schemes.
% In the following, please replace these patterns accordingly:
%
%   YYYY           year of publication
%   Aaaa           first author's surname in CamelCase
%   Bbbb           second author's surname in CamelCase
%
% - for single-author publications:   AaaaYYYY
% - for two-authors publications:     AaaaBbbbYYYY
% - for three or more authors:        AaaaEtAlYYYY
%
% In case an author has published more than one publication in the same year, append lower case
% letters for the second and ongoing publications:
%
%   first publication:   AaaaEtAlYYYY
%   second publication:  AaaaEtAlYYYYb
%
%
% %% Convention for BibTeX fields
%
% Please, stick to the following formatting convention to easy maintainability:
%
% - indent BibTeX fields of entries with 2 spaces (NOT tabs!)
%
% - order the BibTeX fields in alphabetic order
%
% - enclose all values within curly brakets '{...}'
%
% - do line breaks at 100 chars; this is ................................................. here -->|
%
% - and add a continuation indent of 2 after line breaks
%
% - put a colon ',' as well after the last field/value pair of an entry
%
%
% %% Important
